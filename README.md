# ðŸ˜ª Yawning Detection using ResNet18

This project aims to detect yawning in real-time using a deep learning model based on **ResNet18**.  
The system can be used for driver fatigue detection, drowsiness monitoring, or other health-related applications.

## ðŸ§  Overview

Yawning detection is an important task in fatigue detection systems.  
In this project, we fine-tune a **ResNet18** model (pretrained on ImageNet) to classify whether a person is **yawning** or **not yawning** based on facial images.
